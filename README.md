It was a great experience, I had a little bit difficulty with writing doctype
code and i also had to club the ordered list command with anchor command 
which was awesome, i actually wasn't expecting it to work but it freaking did.
Right, another mistake i made was i forget how to stage and commit the file, 
and only after making the file i had to go back to the foundation lessons 
and find that one which had the lesson in it. But overall the experience was great, the webpage looks a pretty stale but i think it will get better 
as i move up.
